# Credit-Default-Risk-Prediction
ï‚·This competition asks you to determine whether a loan will default, as well as the loss incurred if it does fault. Unlike traditional finance based approaches to this problem, where one distinguishes between good or bad counterparties in binary way, we seek to anticipate and incorporate both the default and severity of the losses that result. In doing so, we are building a bridge between traditional banking, where we are looking at reducing the consumption of economic capital, to asset management perspective, where we optimize on the risk to the financial investor.
